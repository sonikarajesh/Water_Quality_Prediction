# Water Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the potability of water by the water quality components. The algorithm used is Decision Tree Classifier. 
The water quality components used for devloping the model are listed below:
1. pH value
2. Hardness
3. Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS)
4. Chloramines
5. Sulfate
6. Conductivity
7. Organic_carbon
8. Trihalomethanes
9. Turbidity
